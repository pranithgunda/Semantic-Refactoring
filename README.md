# Semantic Refactoring

## Description 

Project motive is to optimize the webpage of Horiseon site by refactoring non semantic HTML elements to be semantic for better accessibility standards and increase in site ranking through Search Engine Optimization. I learnt how to efficiently optimize the structure of webpage using various semantic elements that browsers can understand and render web pages efficiently.
